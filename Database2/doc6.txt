This paper sets out, ambitiously, to present a brief reappraisal of software agents research. Evidently, software
agent technology has promised much. However some five years after the word ‘agent’ came into vogue in the
popular computing press, it is perhaps time the efforts in this fledgling area are thoroughly evaluated with a
view to refocusing future efforts. We do not pretend to have done this in this paper – but we hope we have sown
the first seeds towards a thorough first 5-year report of the software agents area. The paper contains some
strong views not necessarily widely accepted by the agent community1.
