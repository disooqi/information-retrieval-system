1.2 What Is a Computer?
A computer is a device capable of performing computations and making logical decisions at speeds millions and even billions of times faster than those of human beings. For example, many of today’s personal computers can perform hundreds of millions—even billions—of additions per second. A person operating a desk calculator might require decades to complete
the same number of calculations that a powerful personal computer can perform in one second. (Points to ponder: How would you know whether the person had added the numbers correctly? How would you know whether the computer had added the numbers correctly?) Today’s fastest supercomputers can perform hundreds of billions of additions per second— about as many calculations as hundreds of thousands of people could perform in one year! Trillion-instruction-per-second computers are already functioning in research laboratories!
Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called computer programs.
These programs guide computers through orderly sets of actions that are specified by individuals known as computer programmers.
A computer is composed of various devices (such as the keyboard, screen, mouse, disks, memory, CD-ROM and processing units) known as hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software. Hardware costs have been declining dramatically in recent years, to the point that personal computers have become a commodity. Softwaredevelopment
costs, however, have been rising steadily, as programmers develop ever more powerful and complex applications without being able to improve significantly the technology
of software development. In this book, you will learn proven software-development methods that can reduce software-development costs—top-down stepwise refinement, functionalization and object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming is widely believed to be the significant breakthrough that can greatly enhance programmer productivity.
