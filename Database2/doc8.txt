Defining an Agent
There is no universally accepted definition of the term agent. Russel and Norvig (1995) define an agent as an entity that can
be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon its environment through effectors. (Coen, 1995)
views software agents as programs that engage in dialogs and negotiate and coordinate the transfer of information.
Wooldridge and Jennings (1995) state that an agent is a hardware and/or software-based computer system displaying the
properties of autonomy, social adeptness, reactivity, and proactivity. Others (Brustolini, 1991; Franklin and Graeser, 1996;
Maes, 1995; Hayes-Roth et al, 1995; Gilbert et al, 1995) offer variations on this theme. There is a consensus that autonomy,
the ability to act without the intervention of humans or other systems, is a key feature of an agent. Beyond that, different
attributes take on different importance based on the domain of the agent.
Figure 1 depicts a high-level view of an agent within its
environment. An agent receives input from its environment and,
through a repertoire of actions available to it, reacts to it in order
to modify it. Generally, in domains of reasonable complexity, an
agent will not have total control over its environment. Thus, the
same action performed twice in seemingly identical situations
might appear to have completely different outcomes. Failure is
also a possibility i.e., the action taken by the agent may not
produce the desired effect at all.
